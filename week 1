# The Ultimate guide to SOC 2 Compliance

SOC 2 compliance is an increasingly common framework and applies to many businesses today.
Specifically, SOC 2 applies to any service provider that stores customer data in the cloud.
It is quite relevant to SaaS businesses, but also to many others who store their customers’ data in this way.
SOC 2 isn't a set of hard and fast rules. Rather, it is a framework that sends a strong signal that an organization
prioritizes key attributes: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
Today, SOC 1 reports are centered around controls impacting financial reports, similar the original SAS 70. SOC 2 reports, on the other hand, are written on audits against the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) standard.
SOC audits are organized around five "Trust Principles."

The Trust Principles are:

‍Security
The foundational security principle, common to all audits.

‍Confidentiality
Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

‍Availability
Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required.

‍Integrity
Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.

‍Privacy
The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.

The SOC 2 reporting standard is defined by the AICPA. All SOC 2 audits are signed by licensed CPAs . To achieve SOC 2 compliance, most companies spend anywhere from six months to a year on focused preparation. This includes identifying which systems are in scope for the audit, developing policies and procedures, and implementing new security controls to reduce risks.
