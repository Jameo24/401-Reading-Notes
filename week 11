# Is Cybersecuriyt Automation the Future?
# Automated Incident Response Explained

Cybersecurity products designed to automate specific processes are widespread, and the likelihood is that you have already implemented automation tools within your organization. For example, vulnerability management products can be configured to automatically detect and scan devices on an enterprise network. They can then conduct an assessment based upon a set of security controls authorized by the organization. Once the assessment is complete, identified defects can be remediated.

When discussing new automation practices, industry experts are generally referring to tools like security automation and orchestration (SOAR) products, robotic process automation (RPA) and custom-developed software and code that automate processes and perform analysis.

Organizations are increasingly placing an emphasis on their digital transformation activities and, as a result, are increasing the technical complexity of their enterprise. This affects the very nature of the work organizations perform, how they stay competitive, how they interact with their customers and their overall level of efficiency. Increasing organizational complexity can lead to significant risk if cybersecurity cannot sufficiently manage the changing environment by properly defending, monitoring and responding to threats.

As companies press forward with a variety of digital transformation activities, it is important to realize that those activities increase the overall attack surface from a corporate espionage perspective.

Many organizations inspect systems and data manually for evidence of unexpected behavior and indicators of compromise or defect.
Automation is not just a technical buzzword or a passing fad. It is being adopted by large and small companies alike. By implementing automation in an organization’s environment, the cybersecurity team can focus on activities that are more complex. This means that the machine can perform the mundane, repeatable work and cybersecurity team members can devote themselves to more critical, creative and technical work to resolve issues and improve the organizational risk posture. Once the appropriate activities are automated, cybersecurity practitioners can focus on projects such as:

• Engineering and Architecture: Automation will allow the cybersecurity team to focus on designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies, including initiatives such as zero trust and cyber hygiene within the enterprise.

• Remediation Activities: The identified deficiencies from your automation efforts will assist your technical and mission teams by providing more repeatable and actionable insight into the enterprise environment leading to fewer vulnerabilities.

• Automation Development and Engineering: Automation will become an important part of the cybersecurity program requiring its own resources related to ongoing and iterative automation design and implementation.
