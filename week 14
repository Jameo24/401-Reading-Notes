#The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems

A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can be an integral part of an organization’s security, but they are just one aspect of many in a cohesive and safe system. They have many great applications, but there are also weaknesses that need to be considered. It is important to compare an NIDS against the alternatives, as well as to understand the best ways to implement them.
Intrusion detection systems are a lot like fire alarms. Just as a fire alarm detects smoke, an intrusion detection system idenitifies incidents and potential threats. They are incredibly useful for raising awareness, but if you don’t hear the alarm or react appropriately, your house may burn down.
An IDS is a visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic. It consists of a management console and sensors. When the sensors encounter something that matches up to a previously detected attack signature, they report the activity to the console. An IDS can notify security personnel of infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers, and even configuration errors.
An NIDS and an HIDS are complementary systems that differ by the position of the sensors: network-based (monitoring the ethernet or WiFi) and host-based, respectively. Because of this, their uses and deployment are quite different.
