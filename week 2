# AWS Architecture Blog-Compute Abstractions on AWS

If you think about what happened in the last 20 years of IT, we have seen a surge of different compute abstractions that changed the way people consume CPU and Memory resources. It all started with physical (x86) servers back in the 80s, and then we have seen the industry adding abstraction layers over the years.
The higher you go in the abstraction levels, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities. A lot of these activities tend to be “undifferentiated heavy lifting.” We define this as something that AWS customers have to do but that don’t necessarily differentiate them from their competitors.
The very first abstraction that was introduced on AWS back in 2006. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is the service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud. When customers intercept us at this level, they retain responsibility of the guest operating system and above (middleware, applications, etc.) and their lifecycle.
At the very same level of the stack there is also Amazon Lightsail, which “is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a simple virtual private server (VPS) solution. Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage websites and web applications in the cloud.”
n 2017, Amazon also announced the intention to release a new service called Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) based on Kubernetes, a successful open source containers control plane technology. Amazon EKS was made generally available in early June 2018.
