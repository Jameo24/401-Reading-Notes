#Application Threat Modeling
#A Beginners Guide To The STRIDE Security Threat Model

Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.
A threat model typically includes:

Description of the subject to be modeled
Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
Potential threats to the system
Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

Threat modeling is a process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all of this information. 
Applied to software, it enables informed decision-making about application security risks. 

One common threat modeling approach is the STRIDE framework, which has six areas of focus:

Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
Denial of Service
Elevation of Privilege
