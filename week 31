# What Are YARA Rules?

YARA is a tool that you can use to track down malware in your computer or network. You create YARA rules to help you find what you want.

Attackers may reuse code in different malware campaigns. YARA rules can look for that code along with some of the malware’s functions and features.

YARA rules work for email as well.

After big cyberattacks or during current cyberattack campaigns, experts may send out YARA rules to help cyber defenders look for the potential poison in their systems.

Just last week — on Valentine’s Day — the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced analysis reports for six new malware samples allegedly in use by North Korea:

—BISTROMATH

—SLICKSHOES

—CROWDEDFLOUNDER 

—HOTCROISSANT

—ARTFULPIE

—BUFFETLINE

DHS provided YARA rules for three of the six malware samples: BISTROMATH, HOTCROISSANT and BUFFETLINE.

YARA rules are only as good as the information they are based on. 
If attackers change up some of their code and features, defenders may have to write new YARA rules.
