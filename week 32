# What is Malware Analysis?

Malware  is defined as “a software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner’s informed consent. 
Any software performing malicious actions, including information stealing, spying, etc., can be referred to as malware.
” As our reliance on technology and the number of connected endpoints increases, traditional malware variants like a virus, Trojan, 
or worm will also start to mutate. This gives rise to new forms of malware, which attack your systems in unfamiliar ways, 
and cause damage without any explicit signal. 

Malware analysis is a highly technical skill and requires years of practice. That is why specialists, like malware analysts, are some of the most 
sought-after profiles in an organization. Malware analyst is a rapidly emerging job profile, seeing a steady increase in demand across the US and 
other digitally mature economies. In June 2017, there were 1,726 job postings for malware analysts for which only 52 candidates applied. This is 
because malware analysis is an arduous process, requiring a wealth of knowledge, a lot of patience, and, occasionally, disruptive thinking.
