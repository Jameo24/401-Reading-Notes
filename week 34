# What is Computer Forensics?

A data breach, identity theft, security issues, illegal activity, corruption. In the world today there is an increasing amount of technology, which means 
there is an increasing amount of security and privacy issues that surround technology as well. 
As an individual you are worried about identity theft and privacy invasion. Businesses are worried 
about data breaches and hackers. And sometimes criminals use computers to commit crimes. As technology evolves, so do the cyber criminals around us.
As cyber criminals get more sophisticated, so do our ways to fight them. Forensic computer or cyber experts are key in the battle against cyber threats. 
Similar to cybersecurity, cyber forensic specialists are charged with helping increase security, fight crime, and create a better, safer future.

While they sound similar, computer forensics and cybersecurity are actually quite different. At the root, cybersecurity is focused on prevention while 
computer forensics is more reactionary in nature. Cybersecurity experts work to keep hackers out, while computer forensics experts focus on how to move 
forward once a hacker has gotten in.
These two fields work directly together in keeping cyber criminals at bay. A cybersecurity team will specifically create security systems to keep data 
and information secure. In the event that their efforts fail, a computer forensics team finds how the breach happened and works to recover the data.
