# Getting Started with Zed Attack Proxy

Software security testing is the process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data. 
There is no universal terminology but for our purposes, we define assessments as the analysis and discovery of vulnerabilities without attempting to 
actually exploit those vulnerabilities. We define testing as the discovery and attempted exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Security testing is often broken out, somewhat arbitrarily, according to either the type of vulnerability being tested or the type of testing being done.
A common breakout is:

Vulnerability Assessment – The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues.
Penetration Testing – The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers.
Runtime Testing – The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user.
Code Review – The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities.

Both manual and automated pentesting are used, often in conjunction, to test everything from servers, to networks, to devices, 
to endpoints. This document focuses on web application or web site pentesting.

Pentesting usually follows these stages:

Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, 
what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, 
and other indications of weakness.
Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.
Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult 
the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation.
