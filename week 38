# What is Burp Suite?

Burp Suite is a suite of tools from PortSwigger designed to aid in the penetration testing of web applications over both HTTP and HTTPS. 
The primary tool is a proxy designed to allow the analysis and editing of web traffic. The proxy can intercept web requests and responses 
and read and edit them in real-time before they reach their respective destinations. Versions are available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, 
along with a JAR file.
The proxy itself allows you to configure which domains have their web traffic intercepted and what sort of traffic is shown. For example, 
intercepting web requests is helpful as you can edit them to test how the website reacts to unusual requests, however intercepting the 
responses as thereâ€™s no real point in editing them.
