#Lessons Learned from the Capital One Data Breach 

On July 19, 2019, we determined that an outside individual gained unauthorized access and obtained certain types of personal information about Capital One credit card customers and individuals who had applied for our credit card products.

Capital One immediately fixed the issue and promptly began working with federal law enforcement. The outside individual who took the data was captured by the FBI. The government has stated they believe the data has been recovered and that there is no evidence the data was used for fraud or shared by this individual.

Safeguarding information is essential to our mission and our role as a financial institution. We have invested heavily in cybersecurity and will continue to do so. We have incorporated the learnings from this incident to further strengthen our cyber defenses.

On January 27, 2021, as a result of Capital Oneâ€™s ongoing analysis of the files stolen by the unauthorized individual in the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident, we discovered approximately 4,700 U.S. credit card customers or applicants whose Social Security Numbers were among the data accessed, but not previously known. Capital One is directly notifying these affected individuals and will make two years of free credit monitoring and identity protection available at no cost to them.

 On February 7, 2022, a U.S. federal court preliminarily approved a class action settlement relating to the cyber incident Capital One announced in July 2019. Please visit www.CapitalOneSettlement.com for additional details.
