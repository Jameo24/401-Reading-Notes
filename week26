PowerShell is a scripting language and a command-line shell based on .NET classes that helps system administrators automate tasks in managing operating systems. It is an update from Microsoftâ€™s command line interpreter (CLI) from the days of MS-DOS, and has been built-in to Windows since the release of Windows XP SP2. While its predecessor, COMMAND.COM, had numerous capabilities and supported a limited scripting language, it could not manage all parts of an operating system (OS), and some tasks still required interaction with the Graphical User Interface (GUI). PowerShell enables faster and improved access to the underlying operating system (such as the registry and certificate store), allowing users and administrators to manage more functions of a system locally as well as remotely. It is also open-sourced and includes a fully developed scripting language. Beyond Windows, PowerShell also supports other platforms such as Linux and macOS.
