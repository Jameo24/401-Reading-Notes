#Log Tampering 101

There is a four-step process to covering your tracks by tamping with logs that hackers know like the back of their hand. These steps are:

Disable auditing
Clearing logs
Modifying logs
Erasing command history

Disable auditing is a smart first step for hackers because if logging is turned off, there will be no trail of evidence. 

One way is to use the clearlogs.exe file, which can be found here. 
Once access to the target Windows system is obtained, the file needs to be installed and then run to clear the security logs. 
To run the file, enter the following into a command line prompt:

clearlogs.exe -sec
